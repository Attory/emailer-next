# Emailer Next

Emailer Next is the clean-room successor to Emailer: a self-hosted email
campaign application for exactly one organisation per installation. The
repository is implementing **Phase 13** and currently identifies as `1.0.0`
with schema `20260828000000`. The Phase 13 branch adds complete Version-1
acceptance tooling, a protected interactive CLI installer, transactional
master-key rotation, license and browser/accessibility policy, and client-grade
`1.0.0` installation/update manuals.

The accepted operator-signed `0.4.0` candidate remains unpublished and
undeployed. A `1.0.0` candidate is not accepted until the Phase 13 head passes
all local/CI gates, independent review, operator signing, and exact-head
approval. No Phase 13 work authorizes client installation or production mail.

## Safe local bootstrap

Docker with the Compose plugin and `curl` are required. From a reviewed clean
checkout:

```bash
./bin/bootstrap
```

The command builds the pinned PHP image, installs exactly from
`composer.lock`, starts MariaDB and Mailpit, runs `composer check`, and verifies
the liveness response. Application and Mailpit ports bind to loopback only;
MariaDB has no host port. The local stack uses synthetic placeholders and
Mailpit, never live SMTP.

See [Installation](docs/installation.md) and
[Development](docs/development.md) before changing the stack.

## Safety status

- The platform targets Symfony 7.4 LTS on tested PHP 8.4 and 8.5 branches.
- Test kernel startup rejects every mail DSN except credential-free Mailpit on
  port 1025, and CI repeats tests on an internal Docker network without external
  egress.
- Structured JSON logs pass through a central redaction processor.
- Composer validation/audit, formatting, static and boundary analysis,
  PHPUnit, MariaDB migration smoke, artifact exposure, and current/history
  secret/private-data scans are aggregated by `composer check`.
- Production artifacts and signed candidates are assembled from an explicit
  allowlist; neither CI nor a phase merge publishes or deploys them.
- Legacy source, history, templates, dependencies, credentials, and private
  records remain prohibited.

See the [Phase 13 report](docs/phase-13-report.md) for current acceptance
evidence, candidate status, limitations, and manual actions. Earlier phase
reports remain the authoritative incremental record.

log, backup, export, or key in the tree, history, fixtures, screenshots,
